# Writing styleguide notes

To be formalized...

**Referencing code block file location**

When adding code blocks that represent snippets of a file, include the location of that file at the beginning of the code block. It should be added in a comment of that file type's style and start at the root of the codebase.

Nunjucks template example:

```django
{# views/layout.html #}
```

Javascript file example:

```javascript
// modules/@apostrophecms/admin-bar/index.js
```

**REST API request types should be written as code.**

Good: Make a `GET` request.
Bad: Make a GET request.

**Highlighting lines of code in code blocks**
For a fun and, importantly, noticeable way to point out key lines of code in code blocks, use finger pointing emojis in comment lines.

Example:

```javascript
module.export = {
  // 👆 Everything inside this is our module.
  extend: '@apostrophecms/piece-type', // 👈 This means we're in a piece type.
  // 👇 Here's where we configure schema fields.
  fields: {
    add: {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

Just don't do it that much. You'd normally not have more than one per code block, if any. In small code blocks it is usually not necessary and could feel excessive. It's especially useful in large code blocks where extra lines are needed for context, but a focal line might be missed otherwise.

```javascript
add: {
  main: {
    label: 'Main column',
    type: 'area',
    options: {
      max: 1, // 👈 Limits the area to a single image widget.
      widgets: {
        '@apostrophecms/image': {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
