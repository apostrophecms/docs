# Apostrophe Essentials Starter Kit

## Requirements For Development On Your Computer

### Operating System: Mac, Linux, or Virtual Linux

**Your local development environment must be either MacOS or Linux.** If your development computer runs Windows, we recommend development on
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Microsoft recommends WSL for Node.js development.

### Software Installation Requirements

To test-drive the project in development, make sure you have Apostrophe's usual dependencies on your local machine:

* MongoDB (5.x or better, we recommend 6.x or better) or an Atlas account
* NodeJS (18.x or better)

For more information see the Apostrophe [Getting Started Tutorial](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.html).
## Getting started

This Starter Kit, also known as a boilerplate project, serves as a template for initiating new projects and can be installed in two main ways:

1. **Using Our CLI Tool**: Run our [CLI tool](https://github.com/apostrophecms/cli) to clone this template locally, install its dependencies, and set up an initial admin user. You accomplish this using:
   
   `apos create <my-project-name>`
> Note that if you are connecting to an MongoDB Atlas instance you should add your connection string to the `APOS_MONGODB_URI` environment variable first. Use:

  ``` sh
  export APOS_MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://username:pa%24%24word@mycluster.1234x.mongodb.net/YOUR-PROJECT-NAME?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
  ```

2. **Manual Setup**: Manually `git clone` this repository and install its dependencies using `npm install`. Then add an initial admin user with `node app @apostrophecms/user:add admin admin`. Again, if using a MongoDB Atlas instance set the `APOS_MONGODB_URI` environment variable first using:

``` sh
export APOS_MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://username:pa%24%24word@mycluster.1234x.mongodb.net/YOUR-PROJECT-NAME?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

For those who need to create multiple projects with additional base modules, consider [forking this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) into your organizational or personal GitHub account. Customize it to fit your needs. To use your customized template, run the following CLI command:

  `apos create <project-name> --starter=<repo-name>`

Here, `<repo-name>` should be the URL of your forked repository, excluding the `https://github.com/` part.

**Note: This template is NOT designed to be installed into an existing project.**

## Running the project

Run `npm run dev` to build the Apostrophe UI and start the site up. Remember, this is during alpha development, so we're all in "dev mode." The `dev` script will watch for saves in client-side CSS and JavaScript and trigger a build and page refresh if they are detected. It will also restart the app when server-side code is saved.

## Making it your own

This boilerplate is designed so you can install and start running it right away. If you are starting a project that will go into production one day, there are a few things you should be sure to check:

- [ ] **Update the shortname.** You don't need to perform this step if you created your project using the CLI tool. The `shortname` option in `app.js` is used for the database name (unless another is given in the `@apostrophecms/db` module). You should change this to an appropriate project name before you start adding any users or content you would like to keep.
- [ ] **Update the Express.js session secret.** The secret is set to `undefined` initially in the `modules/@apostrophecms/express/index.js` file. You should update this to a unique string.
- [ ] **Decide if you want hot reloading on.** This boilerplate uses nodemon to restart the app when files are changed. In `modules/@apostrophecms/asset/index.js` there is an option enabled to refresh the browser on restart. If you like this, do nothing. If you don't, remove the option or set it to `false`. The option has no effect when the app is in production.
- [ ] **Update the `className` options in `app.js`.** This option is set for core widget types to provide CSS styling hooks. It is namespaced with `bp-` for "boilerplate." You will likely want to update that to match your general CSS class naming practices.

## You really want the docs

Right now, [all the juicy info is in the ApostropheCMS docs](https://docs.apostrophecms.org), so head over there and start reading! This boilerplate project is a fun introduction to the UI, but you'll want to know more to really try it out.
