# `radio`

A `radio` field allows a list of options where a user can select one value.

## Module field definition

```javascript
// Configuring the `animalType` field in a module's `fields.add` subsection:
animalType: {
  label: 'Type of animal',
  type: 'radio',
  choices: [
    {
      label: 'Mammals ü¶ß',
      value: 'mammals'
    },
    {
      label: 'Fish üê†',
      value: 'fish'
    },
    {
      label: 'Birds ü¶ú',
      value: 'birds'
    },
    {
      label: 'Reptiles ü¶é',
      value: 'reptiles'
    },
    {
      label: 'Amphibians üê∏',
      value: 'amphibians'
    }
 ]
}
```

|`if` | Object | `{}` | Conditions to meet before the field is active. [See the guide for details.](/guide/conditional-fields) |
|`requiredIf` | Object | `{}` | Conditions to meet before the field is required. [See the guide for details.](/guide/conditional-fields) |
|`hidden` | Boolean | `false` | If `true`, the field is hidden |
|`required` | Boolean | `false` | If `true`, the field is mandatory |
|`readOnly` | Boolean | `false` | If `true`, prevents the user from editing the field value |

<!-- TODO: The following settings are likely to return, but are not yet implemented. -->
<!-- |contextual | Boolean | false | If `true`, it will prevent the field from appearing in the editor modal | -->
<!-- |widgetControls | Boolean | false | If `true`, `select` fields can be edited in line on the page if the field is in a widget | | -->

### `following`
This option should be set to the name of a field or an array of field names that can be used to dynamically create choices based on the value of the followed field(s).

If this field is nested in an `array` or `object` field and is following a field in the parent object, then the name of the field should be prefixed with a `<`, e.g. `following: '<title'`. This hoisting also works if the field is following a field in the parent object from a grand-child `array` or `object` that is nested within a child `array` or `object` using `<<`. This pattern can be extended for additional levels of nesting.

The value(s) of the followed field(s) will be used to create an object with properties composed of the followed schema name for each key, and the current value of that field as value. This object will be passed to the dynamic choices method (see below). Note that the property key in the object is the same as the value passed to the `following` field, including any prepended `<`.

## `choices` configuration

The `choices` setting in `checkboxes`, `radio`, or `select` fields configures the options that a user will see in the interface and the values that the server will allow in validation. The `choices` value is an array of objects with `label` and `value` properties.

- `value` is used in the field's database value
- `label` is the more human-readable version used in interfaces

## Populating `choices` dynamically

What if the choices aren't known in advance or are dependent on the value of another schema field? Then you can fetch them dynamically.

First, set the `choices` option to the name of a [method in your module](../module-api/module-overview.md#methods-self). Pass the name of the method you'll implement on the server side ‚Äî **do not** pass a function, as a string ending in `()`. e.g. `choices: 'getChoices()'`

Second, implement that method in your module so that it takes `(req, data, following)` arguments and return an array of choices in the usual format. You may use an async function, or return a promise that will resolve to the array. That means you can reach out to APIs using modules like `axios` or `node-fetch`, or make Apostrophe database queries.

The `data` argument is an object containing the parent's `docId` for further inspection by your function and is falsey if the document hasn't been published.

The `following` argument is an object containing the schema fields being followed as keys and the value of those fields as values. Note that the key will match the field name(s) in the `following` field array exactly. So if you are passing a parental schema field value in an `object` or `array` schema field, you need to include the prefixing `<` along with the name. See the [`following`](#following) property description.

It is usually a good idea to perform at least short-term caching in your choices method, in order to limit the impact on performance when editing.

``` javascript
module.exports = {
  extend: '@apostrophecms/piece-type',
  options: {
    label: 'Example'
  },
  fields: {
    add: {
      // other schema fields
      region: {
        type: 'select',
        label: 'Region',
        choices: [
          { label: 'North America', value: 'na' },
          { label: 'Europe', value: 'eu' }
        ]
      },
      cities: {
        type: 'radio',
        label: 'Favorite City',
        following: [ 'region' ],
        choices: 'getCities()'
      }
    }
  },
  methods(self) {
    return {
      getCities(req, { docId }, { region }) {
        // Define city choices based on the selected region
        const cityChoices = {
          na: [
            { label: 'New York', value: 'newYork' },
            { label: 'Los Angeles', value: 'losAngeles' },
            { label: 'Chicago', value: 'chicago' }
          ],
          eu: [
            { label: 'Paris', value: 'paris' },
            { label: 'Berlin', value: 'berlin' },
            { label: 'London', value: 'london' }
          ]
        };
        // Return the array of choices for the selected region
        return cityChoices[region] || [];
      }
    };
  }
};
```
## Use in templates

Radio field data is stored as the string `value` property of the selected choice.

```nunjucks
{{ data.piece.animalType }}
```
