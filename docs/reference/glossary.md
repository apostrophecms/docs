# Glossary

While these terms have more common definitions, these descriptions focus on each term's use in the context of Apostrophe.

## General terms

### Core

The term "Apostrophe core," or simply "core," is used frequently throughout this documentation. "Core" refers to the foundational software for all Apostrophe projects. It is the package that a developer would get when installing with `npm i apostrophe` or `yarn add apostrophe`. This documentation focuses on the features in Apostrophe core since those are the features that all Apostrophe projects have in common.

### Module

Apostrophe sites are powered by Apostrophe modules. Each module is responsible for providing one feature, such as a type of widget, a type of customized page, or a service like pushing assets to the browser. Apostrophe has many standard modules which provide its core features.

A module can extend, or "subclass", another module, and most of the modules you create at "project level" (in your project code) will. All modules implicitly extend `@apostrophecms/module`, which provides a rich set of conveniences, like rendering templates or pushing assets relative to your module's folder.

<!-- TODO: Move this description of module directories to a guide page and link there instead. This goes beyond definition. -->

Modules created at project level live in subdirectories of `/modules`. For example, an `article` module would be managed in the `/modules/article` directory. Code and configuration for a module lives in it's `index.js` file (`/modules/article/index.js`, in the example).

### Doc

A "doc" refers to a content-related document in Apostrophe's database. They are in the `aposDocs` MongoDB collection.

Docs contain various properties, including [areas](#area), as described by a schema configured for their **document types** (or "doc type"). Each doc type will extend `@apostrophecms/piece-type`, `@apostrophecms/page-type`, `@apostrophecms/piece-page-type`, or another doc type that itself extends one of those core modules.

At a minimum, a doc has unique `_id` and `slug` properties. The `type` property identifies the doc type and determines what other behaviors it might have. The `@apostrophecms/doc` module provides methods for working with docs, including the `apos.docs.getManager(doc.type)` method, which returns a reference to the module suited to working with that type of document.

### Piece

A "piece" is a unit of standalone, structured, non-page content in Apostrophe. A piece module extends `@apostrophecms/piece-type`. These include core elements such as images and users, as well as project-specific content, such as events or products.

They are not pages themselves, but can be displayed at individual page URLs if there is a matching pieces page type (extending the `@apostrophecms/piece-page-type` module). They could then have individual [show pages](#show-page) once an [index page](#index-page) (an often-paginated listing page) of that type is created.

### Page

A doc that is part of the page tree and is designed to be viewed like any traditional web page. It can potentially have "child" pages via the page tree hierarchy. Pages belong to particular "page types," and may have custom fields based on their type, but are not displayed in an index listing as pieces are.

Their `slug` property begins with `/`, which is only true for pages. A page also has `path`, `rank` and `depth` properties that help make its relationship to other pages in the tree clear.

`path` differs from `slug` in that it always reflects the true parent-child relationships between pages in the tree, while `slug` can be edited and shortened if desired so that URLs don't have to contain a lot of slashes to reach a deep page.

### Index page

An index page, is a special [page](#page) that is built to display a listing of [pieces](#piece). Index pages extend the `@apostrophecms/piece-page-type` module. In addition to data available to all pages, index page templates have access to a `data.pieces` array, which contains objects representing individual pieces, limited by the pieces page `perPage` option and the state of pagination. Index pages also have `data.currentPage` and `data.totalPages` number values available to support pagination.

### Show page

Despite their name, these are not [pages](#page) in the sense of extending the `@apostrophecms/page-type` module. They therefore do not have individual representation in the page tree. They are a feature, enabled by creating an [index page](#index-page), providing individual URLs that display a rendered template for individual [pieces](#piece). **A blog listing is an "index page" and the individual blog post is a "show page."**

Show page templates (`show.html`), do have access to their parent index page's `data.page` object, but they also have access to `data.piece`, which contains all of the data for a particular piece.

### Global doc

There is a single doc with the slug, `global`, which is always loaded and available to page templates as `data.global`. This is useful for shared, site-wide headers and footers that are editable, etc. It is managed by the `@apostrophecms/global` module.

### Slug

The slug of an Apostrophe doc is a string that uniquely identifies that doc within the database. Apostrophe will enforce that no two docs have the same slug. Slugs _can_ be changed, unlike the `_id` property of the database document. The Apostrophe user interface and REST API will suggest slugs automatically based on the document's title on creation.

If the doc is a page, or a piece with a [show page](#show-page), the slug is used as a component of the page URL. This works differently for pages and pieces.

- [Page](#page) slugs begin with a forward slash and, by default, include sections for their parent pages, e.g., `/previous-page/new-page` for a page titled "New Page" with a parent page of "Previous Page." Editing a page slug will not effect the actual page tree structure.
- [Piece](#piece) slugs do not begin with a forward slash nor do they include reference to an [index page](#index-page). A piece titled "New Piece" will get the suggested slug of `new-piece` if no other doc has that slug already.

### Widget

A widget is a single section of content in an [area](#area) that can usually be edited, such as a block of rich text, an image slideshow, or a callout block. You can create entirely new types of widgets by extending the `@apostrophecms/widget-type` module.

### Area

An area is a special field in a piece or page where you can add any number of widgets of any type, as configured for that piece or page type. Editors can add, edit, move, and remove widgets within the area. Widgets in the area maintain their order for consistent displaying.

Areas are inserted into your templates using the [`area` template tag](/guide/areas-and-widgets.md). They are implemented by the `@apostrophecms/area` module.

### Template

Apostrophe uses the [Nunjucks template language](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to render webpages and components of pages, such as widgets and [blocks](#block). Nunjucks shares a syntax with the Jinja and Twig languages which are popular in the Python and PHP worlds, respectively.

### Block

In Nunjucks templates, [a block is a section of a template that can be overridden in a template that extends it](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#block). This is a useful technique in page templates when paired with [template inheritance](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#template-inheritance).

### Schema

A piece, page, or widget type's schema is the definition of its fields. Apostrophe's schemas are used both to create an editing interface and to sanitize and save data on the server side. Commonly used field types include strings, integers, floats, select elements and "relationship" fields, which allow editors to define connections to other docs.

Schemas are built by using the `add`, `remove`, and `group` properites of the `fields` option when configuring any module that extends `@apostrophecms/piece-type`, `@apostrophecms/page-type`, or `@apostrophecms/widget-type`.

Here is a simple example in which we add a required "author" string field to the schema for "story," a custom piece type:

```javascript
// modules/story/index.js in our project
module.exports = {
  extend: 'apostrophe-pieces',
  name: 'story',
  fields: {
    add: {
      author: {
        type: 'string',
        required: true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- See the [apostrophe-schemas](/reference/modules/apostrophe-schemas/README.md) module documentation for more information. -->

### Relationship

In [Apostrophe schemas](#schema), a "relationship" field describes a connection with another doc. A development agency might want to connect "services" to "projects," or you might want to select "office" pieces for display in the website footer.

In that second case, the schema containing the relationship field might look like this:

```javascript
fields: {
  add: {
    _offices: {
      label: 'Offices',
      type: 'relationship',
      withType: 'office'
    }
  }
}
```

The editing interface for this join allows the user to pick offices to associate with this service. When writing templates, the developer is then able to access a `._offices` array as a property of each service.

<!-- See the [apostrophe-schemas](/reference/modules/apostrophe-schemas/README.md) module documentation for more information about joins. -->

<!-- TODO: Display this when other locale information is added. -->
<!-- ### Document set

The database documents that exist as mode and locale versions of one another. For example, in a project with an English and a French locale, the home page would be managed in the database by six documents: 1) the draft English, 2) published English, 3) previous English, 4) draft French, 5) published French, and 6) previously published French. These six database documents make up the document set. -->


### Shortname

An Apostrophe website's shortname is used as the primary identifier for the application. It is used as the Express session name and by default is the database name and part of the CSRF cookie name. It is a top-level property of the application object we [configure in a project's `app.js` file](/guide/development-setup.md#creating-a-project) as `shortName`.

## User interface terms

### Manager

The manager, or manager modal, is a UI modal that displays a table or list of pages or pieces of a particular doc type. Pages are displayed in one manager and every piece type is displayed in their own manager modals. This UI is usually opened by clicking or triggering the doc type's button in the admin bar. The manager is also used as a "chooser" when browsing pages or pieces for a relationship field.

### Editor

The editor modal is a traditional interface with [discrete fields](/reference/field-types/index.md) to add or update a document's content. This is distinct from the "in-context" editing experience where editors update content in the page as any visitor would see it.

## Localization terms

Apostrophe generally subscribes to [the W3C definitions](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n.en) of the following terms. These definitions borrow from their descriptions with a focus on use with Apostrophe.

### Localization

"Localization," often abbreviated as **l10n**, is the process of adapting the Apostrophe user interface and Apostrophe website content for different groups of people (usually based on language and country). This can include text translation, date formats, content variation, and much more.

### Locale

A locale is a content classification used to associate certain content and l10n settings with a group of people. Locales may be languages (e.g., English, Spanish), countries (e.g., Canada, France), combinations of the two (e.g., Canadian French, Canadian English), or really any significant group of website visitors.

### Internationalization

"Internationalization," often abbreviated as **i18n**, refers to the whole system that supports localization. This is why the primary core Apostrophe module related to these topics is `@apostrophecms/i18n`. We can think of i18n as the tools and l10n as how people use them to make content more accessible to different peoples.
