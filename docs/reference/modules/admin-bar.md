# `@apostrophecms/admin-bar`

**Alias:** `apos.adminBar`

<AposRefExtends :module="$frontmatter.extends" />

This module implements Apostrophe's admin bar at the top of the page. Any module can register a button (or more than one) for the bar by calling this module's `add` method. Buttons can also be grouped into dropdown menus and restricted to those with particular permissions. The [@apostrophecms/piece-type module](/reference/modules/piece-type.md) takes advantage of this module automatically.

## Configuration options

Options are passed into the admin-bar module by creating a `modules/@apostrophecms/admin-bar/index.js` file in our project. Our project-specific configuration will merge gracefully with the defaults that come with the module.

|  Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
|`groups` | Array | Adds one or more menu item group objects to be displayed in dropdown menus |

### `groups`

The `groups` option takes an array of one or more objects that group several menu items together in the admin bar as a dropdown menu. Each of the `groups` objects requires a `label` and an array of menu `items`. The `label` will be used as the label displayed in the menu. The `items` array contains the names of the individual menu items you want to appear in the dropdown, entered in the order you want them to appear. Note: Menu names for `piece-type` items are the name of the piece-type, not the label. For core items, like 'Images', the name is prefixed - '@apostrophecms/image'.

**Example**

<AposCodeBlock>

```javascript

module.exports = {
 options: {
   groups: [
     {
       name: 'media',
       label: 'Media',
       items: [
         '@apostrophecms/image',
         '@apostrophecms/file',
         '@apostrophecms/image-tag',
         '@apostrophecms/file-tag'
       ]
     }
   ]
 }
};
```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/@apostrophecms/admin-bar/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

This will result in grouping those four core modules into a single dropdown menu displayed as 'Media' on the menu bar.

## Featured methods

The following method belongs to this module and may be useful in project-level code. See the [source code](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/blob/main/modules/%40apostrophecms/admin-bar/index.js) for all methods that belong to this module.
<!-- Some are used within the module and would just create noise here. -->

Because this module has an alias, you can call these from another module from the alias path. For example, `self.apos.adminBar.add()`.

### `add(name, label, permission, options)`

Add an item to the menu bar.

The `name` for the item must be unique within the menu bar to avoid conflicts. When the menu item is clicked, the `name` argument will be emitted on `apos.bus` as the value of an `admin-menu-click` event. If this item controls a specific modal, this will be caught by `TheAposModals` to display the correct modal. If this is the case, `name` should be the module name with a `:editor` or `:manager` suffix. For example, `@apostrophecms/global:editor`. A more complex example is contained within the [`@apostrophecms/login` module](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/blob/main/modules/%40apostrophecms/login/ui/apos/apps/AposLogin.js).

**Example**

Code added to handle click events on the new button in the admin UI frontend:

<AposCodeBlock>

```javascript
export default () => {
  apos.bus.$on('admin-menu-click', async (item) => {
    // Make sure it is the button we care about, leave others to their own handlers
    if (item !== 'myCustomModule') {
      return;
    }
    // Custom code for button action
  });
}
```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    /modules/myCustomModule/ui/apos/apps/CustomFunctions.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

::: info
Make sure to add this to the `ui/apos/apps/` folder, or import it into a file located there. If you try to load this code by adding it to `ui/src` you will get an error in the console because the admin functions won't be available, yet.
:::

The `label` will be the name displayed for the button on the menu bar.

`permission` is optional and takes an object with `action` and `type` properties. If no permissions are present, anyone can see the button. The `action` property dictates what type of action the button will perform. These include `view`, `view-draft`, `edit`, `publish`, `upload-attachment`, and `delete`. The `type` property matches the name of the module the button is managing. This type must have a registered manager.

`options` can take several properties that control the positioning and display of the new menu item.

|  Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `last` | Boolean | If truthy, it will cause the button to be displayed at the end of the list. |
| `contextUtility` | Boolean | If truthy, it will cause the button to be displayed in the tray of icons to the left of the page settings gear. |
| `icon` | String | If `contextUtility` is `true` an icon name is required for display. |
| `toggle` | Boolean | If truthy, the button will remain active until it is clicked a second time. |
| `tooltip` | Object \|\| String | Depending on the `toggle` value, a tooltip string or an object with `activated` and `deactivated` strings. |
| `user` | Boolean | Adds the button alongside the "Log Out" button on the personal dropdown at the upper right. Should be reserved for items that manage personal settings. |

#### `last`

If the `last` property is set to ‘true’, the button will be displayed as the last item in the left list of buttons. Note: If more than one button has this property, the last one loaded will win.

#### `contextUtility`

If the `contextUtility` property is set to `true`, the button will be displayed as an icon in the tray of icons to the left of the page settings gear.

#### `icon`

 For proper display when setting `contextUtility` to true, a property of `icon` set to the value of an existing icon must also be passed. More can be read about icons [here](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/reference/module-api/module-overview.html#icons). A list of the icons imported automatically by Apostrophe can be found in the [‘asset’ module in the ‘globalIcos.js’ file’ within the ‘lib’ folder](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/blob/main/modules/%40apostrophecms/asset/lib/globalIcons.js).

#### `toggle`

The `toggle` property is used in conjunction with `contextUtility`. If it set to `true` then the button will toggle between active and inactive states. This allows the addition of different tooltip text depending on state.

#### `tooltip`
The `tooltip` property can take either a string or an object. If `toggle` is falsy, then the value of `tooltip` is a string to display on hover. If `toggle` is truthy, then `tooltip` takes an object with two arguments, `activate` and `deactivate`. Both properties accept string values with the former being displayed for the activated state and the later the deactivated state.

### `getShowAdminBar(req)`
This method determines whether the admin-bar should be displayed. At project level, this method should be extended in the `modules/@apostrophecms/admin-bar/index.js` file `extendMethods(self)` customization function and should return a boolean value. By default, it returns the value of `!!req.user`, which is true if a user is logged in. An example of how to use this method is shown in the [custom admin ui](/guide/custom-ui.html#toggling-the-admin-bar-visibility) section of the documentation.
