:::

We're thrilled to guide you on this explorative journey through the ApostropheCMS ecosystem. Our goal with this series of tutorials is to provide a robust foundation to comprehend and harness the power of ApostropheCMS effectively.

Throughout this tutorial, we will incrementally construct a sample website using the Apostrophe  Essentials starter kit. This website will be similar to the [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/) site and provide a wealth of opportunities to learn about the essential elements of ApostropheCMS pages, pieces, templates, and components. Please note that this project is designed as a learning tool, rather than a ready-to-use template for your individual projects.

We have structured this project into distinct sections, each focusing on a specific building block of ApostropheCMS. These sections are interdependent, often expanding or refining the code from the preceding ones. However, the code from each tutorial can act as the basis for custom modules in your own project and be used as practical examples alongside our guide and reference material.

To help guide you along your development journey, the finalized code for this project can be found on the `main` branch of our [GitHub project repository](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-onboarding-project). The repository also includes a database with sample content and images. You'll find the repo is organized into branches that correspond to specific tutorials. For a smoother experience and additional details on how to use the project repository, please take a look at the [README](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-onboarding-project#readme) file for that repository. While you can certainly refer to the completed code, we encourage you to try building the project yourself for a more valuable learning experience.

## **Summary of what we are covering per section**

### Code Overview

Before digging into custom code creation, we are going to spin up a new project using the Essentials starter kit and take a look at code organization in Apostrophe. We'll examine how core modules are improved and organized, but also how to organize project-specific modules and extend the core modules in your custom code. This section will also touch briefly on some of the initialization and customization functions that are available to us to help build a custom web experience.

### Pages

![Screenshot of the index.js and view.html code of the home page](../images/sec2-1-pages-comp.jpg)

Our journey begins with a key component of any website, pages. As we start building our product review site, we'll develop a landing page, category-specific pages, and individual product pages. One of the standout features of ApostropheCMS is its ability to programmatically generate a multitude of sub-pages from a single template. This means you can focus on crafting one exemplary template, and ApostropheCMS will do the heavy lifting of creating numerous sub-pages, eliminating the need to write additional code for each page.

Now, let's delve into the specific topics from the ApostropheCMS documentation that we'll be addressing in this section:

- **Introduction to the Module Schema:** We'll start with an overview of schema fields. [Schemas](/guide/core-concepts.html#schemas) in Apostrophe are a powerful tool to structure your data, allowing you to specify the types of content your users can add or edit. 

- **Incorporating Areas and Built-in Widgets:** Next, we'll introduce you to 'areas', a flexible content container that can include various types of widgets. We will start by utilizing several of the widgets that come built-in with Apostrophe and understanding how we can pass them per-page options.
