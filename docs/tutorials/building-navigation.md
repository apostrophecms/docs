# Building site navigation

Almost every website needs some kind of primary navigation. For Apostrophe sites there are two main approaches to adding and maintaining site navigation:

1. **Use the page tree** to automatically generate navigation for pages
2. **Manually build the site nav** using an array field

::: info
This code recipe discusses specifically how to build site-wide navigation. Keep in mind that the same concepts can be applied to build other kinds of navigation, including nav for certain sections of at website or contextual nav for a page's children.
:::

## Generating site navigation from the page tree

One of the defining features of pages in Apostrophe is that they exist in a hierarchy. Even if we added all pages on a website as siblings (the same hierarchy level) they would still all be children of the home page. This structure is expressed through the [page tree](/guide/pages.md#connecting-pages-with-page-tree-navigation).

The Apostrophe demo site is a small example of common page tree structure. Under the home page there are two **top-level pages**. One of those pages, "Editor Experience," has three additional **child pages**, making it their **parent page**. These pages can all be rearranged through drag-and-drop interaction.

![Screenshot of the Apostrophe demo page structure in the page manager UI](/images/recipes/demo-page-tree.png)

Apostrophe templates have access to this page tree using `data.home._children`, an array of top-level page data objects. Templates also have access to the children of the page a visitor is on, but since we're focused on the main site navigation, we want to use the home page's children. Home page children do not change as visitors move around the website.

As explained on the [pages guide](/guide/pages.md#connecting-pages-with-page-tree-navigation), we can loop over `data.home._children` and print the pages' URLs and titles in a list. Once you add some classes and CSS, this can work great as site navigation. And since it is based on the page tree structure **it will automatically stay up to date as editors update page content**.

<AposCodeBlock>

  ``` nunjucks
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        {# ðŸ‘‡ Referencing `data.home._children` and looping over them. #}
        {% for page in data.home._children %}
          <li>
            <a href="{{ page._url }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
          </li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    views/layout.html
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

### Change page tree data in templates

The example above is a very simple site navigation. It includes only the top-level pages and the basic data available for each page. In some cases you may want different data from the page tree for your navigation. The direct way to do this is to alter the **query builders** that the core page module uses to get that data.

The *default* query builder options for the page module look like this:

<AposCodeBlock>

  ``` javascript
  module.exports = {
    options: {
      builders: {
        children: true,
        ancestors: {
          children: true
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/@apostrophecms/page/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

For example, **to include two levels of pages in template ancestor data** we would add to the `builders` option that ancestors (such as the home page) should include two levels of child pages (`depth: 2`).

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    options: {
      builders: {
        children: true,
        // `ancestors` includes the home page, so we adjust things there.
        ancestors: {
          children: {
            depth: 2
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/@apostrophecms/page/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

::: info
If using the `depth: 2` builder option, the each page in the `data.home._children` array will include their own `_children` array with any child pages, if they have any.
:::

By default the page data object includes all properties from the database document. We can **limit that returned data** (for a minor speed improvement and clearer logging). One good approach to this is to set `areas: false` and `relationships: false` to remove area and relationship field data, which can get large.

<AposCodeBlock>

  ``` javascript
  module.exports = {
    options: {
      builders: {
        children: true,
        ancestors: {
          children: {
            depth: 2,
            areas: false,
            relationships: false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/@apostrophecms/page/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

If pages had **thumbnail images we wanted to show in the navigation**, we can include that as well. If we had added an area field called `thumbnail` to the page schema, we could adjust our `areas` option to only include that one area field by name. (The relationship field data from the image widget isn't stored directly on the page.)

<AposCodeBlock>

  ``` javascript
  module.exports = {
    options: {
      builders: {
        children: true,
        ancestors: {
          children: {
            depth: 2,
            // ðŸ‘‡ Now including the area data
            areas: [ 'thumbnail' ],
            relationships: false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/@apostrophecms/page/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

We would then display the image [using an `area` tag](/guide/media.html#the-image-widget-option) or [the template methods for accessing the image attachment](/guide/media.html#the-relationship-field-option).

As you can see, page templates come ready with page tree data that is ready to become site navigation. With additional configuration, we can customize the data that templates give us. The examples above are only a few such ways to configure it.

## Add fields for manual nav building

The other common approach to site navigation is to let editors build it manually. They would be able to choose the specific page links and the order in which the links should appear. Since the site nav is the same across every page (in most cases), we store the navigation data in [global settings](/guide/global.md).

Before we look at a code example, let's think about how we would want to define fields for site navigation.

- Website navigation is an ordered list of links, some of which might contain their own list of links (second-level navigation). This translates well to an array structure, so **we use an [`array` field](/reference/field-types/array.md)**.
- Navigation items might usually be pages on the website, but they also might be external links, links to files, or even might not be links at all in order to prioritize a second-level navigation. We won't get into all of those cases, but this means that we want to **let editors choose the navigation item type**.
- Finally, each type of navigation item works differently. We will **use conditional logic to only show the correct fields** based on the chosen nav item type.

With those ideas in mind, we can look at an example of project-level global module configuration that adds a navigation array field. To keep this relatively simple this will only include two navigation item types.

<AposCodeBlock>

  ``` javascript
  module.exports = {
    fields: {
      add: {
        // Adding our array field, `primaryNav`
        primaryNav: {
          label: 'Primary site navigation',
          type: 'array',
          titleField: 'label',
          // The array schema for each item
          fields: {
            add: {
              label: {
                label: 'Nav item label',
                type: 'string'
              },
              type: {
                label: 'Link type',
                type: 'select',
                choices: [
                  {
                    label: 'Page',
                    value: 'page'
                  },
                  {
                    label: 'Custom URL',
                    value: 'custom'
                  }
                ]
              },
              _page: {
                label: 'Page to link',
                type: 'relationship',
                withType: '@apostrophecms/page',
                max: 1,
                required: true,
                builders: {
                  project: {
                    title: 1,
                    _url: 1
                  }
                },
                // Only if it's a page link
                if: {
                  type: 'page'
                }
              },
              customUrl: {
                label: 'URL for custom link',
                type: 'url',
                required: true,
                // Only if it's a custom link
                if: {
                  type: 'custom'
                }
              },
              // A nice option to have the link open in a new tab
              target: {
                label: 'Will the link open a new browser tab?',
                type: 'checkboxes',
                choices: [
                  {
                    label: 'Open in new tab',
                    value: '_blank'
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/@apostrophecms/global/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

The field schema above adds an array field whose schema has five additional fields (remember: array fields have their own field schema for each array item):

1. The nav item label, which is also the array field's `titleField` for the user interface
2. The link type (linking to an internal page or external URL)
3. A relationship field to an internal page, if the page link option is chosen
4. A URL field, if the custom URL option is chosen
5. An option to mark the link to open in a new tab (a nice option for editors to have)

![The global settings editor with nav array field](/images/recipes/nav-array-field.png)

![The nav items array editor showing custom URL fields](/images/recipes/nav-array-schema.png)

The final step is to turn the array data from this into template markup. We will loop over the array of links and render the links based on what type they are. Page links are relationship data, so they are constructed differently from custom URL links, which are simply string values.


<AposCodeBlock>

  ``` nunjucks
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        {# ðŸ‘‡ Referencing the global doc `primaryNav` property #}
        {% for item in data.global.primaryNav %}
          <li>
            {% set path = '' %}
            {% set pageTitle = '' %}
            {% set selectedClass = '' %}
            {% if item.type === 'page' and item._page and item._page[0] %}
              {% set path = item._page[0]._url %}
              {% set pageTitle = item._page[0].title %}
              {% if data.page.title == pageTitle %}
                {% set selectedClass = 'selected' %}
              {% endif %}
            {% elif item.type === 'custom' %}
              {% set path = item.customUrl %}
            {% endif %}
            <a href="{{ path }}" class="{{ selectedClass }}"
              {% if item.target[0] === '_blank' %} target="_blank" {% endif %}
            >{{ item.label or pageTitle }}</a>
          </li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  ```

In addition to adding more link types to the schema, the template example can be changed depending on the project needs.

## Constructing breadcrumb navigation

Breadcrumb navigation shows visitors the series of pages from the page they are on back to the home page. It could end with some other major landing page, but our example will lead back to the home page. To add bread crumbs to a page we use very similar techniques to those shown above for a website's primary navigation. Instead of using `data.home`, we use `data.page._ancestors`.

**What is breadcrumb navigation, really?** If we think through the pieces of breadcrumb nav, we are looking at: *A series of links, usually starting with the home page, proceeding through the page tree, down to the page we are on.*

`data.page._ancestors` perfectly matches this goal. It is an array of page objects, starting with the home page, continuing through the page tree and ending with the parent of the rendered page. Perfect! To turn that into a breadcrumb navigation, we simply need to **loop through `data.page._ancestors`, add a link for each ancestor**.

The only tricky part comes at the end. If a visitor is on a piece's [show page](/guide/piece-pages.md#the-show-page-template), then `data.page` will actually be the index page. If `data.piece` exists (indicating we're rendering a show page), we will link to the index page (`data.page`) in the breadcrumbs, otherwise we'll simply print the current page's title.

<AposCodeBlock>

  ``` nunjucks
  {# Breadcrumb trail to the current page or piece. Not on the home page #}
  {% if data.page and data.page._ancestors.length %}
    <nav class="breadcrumb">
      {# Loop over the ancestors. #}
      {% for page in data.page._ancestors %}
        <a href="{{ page._url }}">{{ page.title }}</a> âž¡
      {% endfor %}
      {% if data.piece %}
        {# We're rendering a show page. #}
        <a href="{{ data.page._url }}">{{ data.page.title }}</a>  âž¡
        <span>{{ data.piece.title }}</span>
      {% else %}
        {# We're rendering a normal page. #}
        <span>{{ data.page.title }}</span>
      {% endif %}
    </nav>
  {% endif %}
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    views/layout.html
  </template>
