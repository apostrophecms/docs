# Pages and page types

Every page in an Apostrophe website is assigned a **"page type"**. The page type tells Apostrophe **what template to use** to render the page and **what configuration to apply**. Configurations will often at least include the field schema for the page type.

## Creating a page type

Apostrophe core only includes a "Home page" type with some basic default content options. You will likely need your own page types, which you create by adding modules that extend `@apostrophecms/page-type` and instantiating them in `app.js`.

```js
// modules/default-page/index.js
module.exports = {
  extend: '@apostrophecms/page-type'
};
```

```js
// app.js
require('apostrophe')({
  shortName: 'my-website',
  modules: {
    'default-page': {}
  }
});
```

<!-- TODO: Replace area field link to a guide page when available. -->
If we add a string field for the subtitle and an [area field](/reference/field-types/area.md) for rich text and images, the Default page type would look like:

```js
// modules/default-page/index.js
module.exports = {
  extend: '@apostrophecms/page-type',
  fields: {
    add: {
      subtitle: {
        type: 'string'
      },
      main: {
        type: 'area',
        options: {
          widgets: {
            '@apostrophecms/rich-text': {},
            '@apostrophecms/image': {}
          }
        }
      }
    },
    group: {
      basics: {
        fields: ['title', 'subtitle', 'main']
      }
    }
  }
};
```

See the [field schema](/guide/content-schema.md) page for more on configuring fields.

::: tip
We can add functionality to the default home page type by adding a configuration file for it at `modules/@apostrophecms/home-page/index.js`. Add new fields to it as in the example above and this core page type will be ready for additional content possibilities. Or it will be once we update its page template... See below.
:::

## Page template essentials

Each page type requires a template. The only exception to that rule is if a page type extends another page type that already has a template.

Page templates are added in a `views` directory for the page type as `page.html`. The template for the previous example's default page would be `modules/default-page/views/page.html`. A very simple page template for the Default page might look like this:
<!-- TODO: Consider adding a file tree component when available. -->

```django
{# modules/default-page/views/page.html #}
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block main %}
  <header>
    <h1>{{ data.page.title }}</h1>
    {% if data.page.subtitle %}
      <p>{{ data.page.subtitle }}</p>
    {% endif %}
  </header>
  {% area data.page, 'main' %}
{% endblock %}
```

There are a number of things at work here.

### The template is extending a `layout.html` template

```django
{% extends "layout.html" %}
```

`layout.html` is a base level template [used in official Apostrophe boilerplates](https://github.com/apostrophecms/a3-boilerplate/blob/main/views/layout.html) and placed in `views/layout.html`. It is used to add markup for things that belong on every page, such as the website navigation and footer. It extends the `outerLayout.html` template from Apostrophe core, but provides a layer to customize the page wrapper while not overwriting `outerLayout.html`.

The layout template might look something like this:

```django
{% extends data.outerLayout %}

{% block beforeMain %}
<div>
  <header>
    {# Page header code: logo, navigation, etc. #}
  </header>
  <main>
{% endblock %}

{% block main %}
  {# Page body content. Pages templates normally override this. #}
{% endblock %}

{% block afterMain %}
  </main>
  <footer>
    {# Page header code: contact information, secondary navigation, etc. #}
  </footer>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

### We are inserting page template markup in a template block

```django
{% block main %}
{% endblock %}
```

Apostrophe uses the Nunjucks template language, which has a [block system](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#block) for injecting markup into lower-level templates. The block system involves placing a `block` tag in the root-level template file, then using those blocks in higher-level templates to insert markup. Since we used the `main` block here it will overwrite the layout template's `main` block.

### Page data is on `data.page`

```django
{{ data.page.title }}
```

Templates have access to a `data` object containing information about the Apostrophe application and current context data. In page templates, `data.page` contains data for the active page. For our Default page, that includes the title, subtitle, "main" area, and lots of other information.

Naming specific properties in the double brackets syntax, `{{}}`, prints them in the template.

```django
{% if data.page.subtitle %}
  <p>{{ data.page.subtitle }}</p>
{% endif %}
```

Nunjucks offers additional tags, including the [`{% if %}` conditional tag](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#if), to help work with data in templates.

::: tip
If you want to know what is available in a template object, you can log it in your terminal using the template method `apos.log()`. This looks like:

```django
{{ apos.log(data.page) }}
```
:::

### The widget area is added using the `area` tag

```django
{% area data.page, 'main' %}
```

This is a special tag in Apostrophe used to let editors add and manage content widgets to the page. After the `area` tag name, we pass the tag the field's context, which is our page, followed by the field name. We [configured it in the `index.js` file](#creating-a-page-type) to use two widget types. While editing the page, the user will have access to a menu to add widgets of those types.

![A page with the area menu opened](/images/page-area.jpg)

We'll explore areas more in [the areas guide](/guide/areas-and-widgets.md).

::: tip
To overwrite the home page type template, create a template file for it at  `modules/@apostrophecms/home-page/views/page.html` and add template markup.

## Activating page types

 There is one more step to make a page type available to use: You'll need to add it to the core page module's `type` option. This configures the "Type" field for pages.

![A page editing modal with the type field highlighted](/images/page-type-select.jpg)

This is a core module option, but you can add your own configuration by giving it an `index.js` file in your project: `modules/@apostrophecms/page/index.js`. You'll then configure it's `types` option with all page types you want to allow.

```javascript
// modules/@apostrophecms/page/index.js
module.export = {
  options: {
    types: [
      // 👇 Adding our new page type
      {
        name: 'default-page',
        label: 'Default page'
      },
      // 👇 Optionally including the core "Home page" type
      {
        name: '@apostrophecms/home-page',
        label: 'Home page'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each type needs a `name` matching the module's name and a label for editors. See the reference section for [other core page module options](/reference/module-api/module-options.md#options-for-the-core-page-module).

## Connecting pages with page tree navigation

<!-- TODO: Link to a guide on building manual navigation widgets or through
     the global doc when available. -->
There are many ways to build navigation with Apostrophe. One is to base site navigation on the page tree. The **"page tree"** refers to the parent-child relationship between pages. For example, the home page is the parent of all top-level pages, which may have subpages of their own.

Pages can be organized into a page tree hierarchy while adding them or through the page manager interface.

![A modal interface with pages organized in order and nested under one another](/images/page-tree.png)

Apostrophe templates have data available to add navigation based on the page tree. This includes:

| Data object | What is it? |
| ------ | ------ |
| `data.home` | Home page data. It is similar to the data on `data.page`, but always references the home page. |
| `data.home._children` | Page data for pages one level below the home page in the page tree. |
| `data.page._ancestors` | Page data for the ancestors of the active page, starting with the home page. |
| `data.page._children` | Page data for pages one level *below* the active page. |

By default, one level of children are available on each ancestor, as well as on the home page and `data.page`.

With that available data, we could construct navigation for the website header using the Nunjucks `{% for %}` loop tag. The `layout.html` `beforeMain` block could look like:

```django
{# views/layout.html #}
{% block beforeMain %}
<div>
  <header>
    {# 👇 Adding our navigation wrapper. #}
    <nav>
      <ul>
        {# 👇 Referencing `data.home._children` and looping over them. #}
        {% for page in data.home._children %}
          <li>
            <a href="{{ page._url }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
          </li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
{% endblock %}
```

This is looping over the home page's child pages, printing their URLs and titles into links. This is simply one way to add navigation using the page data in templates.
