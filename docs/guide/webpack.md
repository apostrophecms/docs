# Webpack

In modern Apostrophe (>=4.9.0), there are now two methods available for building project assets. By default, Apostrophe uses a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)-powered process to compile frontend JavaScript and SCSS automatically, so following the [frontend asset documentation](front-end-assets.md) is usually all you need. For those who prefer, Apostrophe now offers an optional build process using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for either the Admin UI or public-facing assets. For details, refer to the [Vite configuration documentation](vite.md).

Sometimes we want to extend the way webpack processes our frontend code, specifically in two ways:

* By changing the webpack rules (the webpack configuration) via "extensions," or
* By breaking up the bundle into two or more files, to be loaded only on pages that really require them ("extra bundles").

This guide covers how to address both situations.

## Extending Webpack configuration

If you need webpack to do things that Apostrophe doesn't do by default, you can extend Apostrophe's webpack configuration to change the way code in `ui/src` is compiled.

Why might you want to do this? perhaps you want to add a new loader for a specific file type, such as `.jsx`. Or perhaps you want to add aliases to load imported modules from a nonstandard location.

It's possible to extend the webpack config from any module. To do so add a `webpack` property at module root, like so:

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      // ...
      webpack: {
        extensions: {
          utilsAlias: {
            resolve: {
              alias: {
                'Utils': path.join(process.cwd(), 'lib/utils/')
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    };
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/my-module/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

Note that `extensions` is an object with named sub-properties. Each one is separately merged with the webpack configuration.

::: info
Everything inside `utilsAlias` in the above example is merged with the webpack configuration. It is not specific to Apostrophe. If you are not familiar with webpack configuration, see the [webpack configuration documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/).
:::

::: warning
Any extensions you make to webpack apply to all files compiled as part of Apostrophe's public build (anything coming from `ui/src` folders). Take care not to break reasonable assumptions made by other developers. For example, adding custom aliases and loaders for new file extensions is OK. Changing `.js` files to only compile if they are valid TypeScript would not be OK and you can expect it to break other modules in your project.

The Apostrophe admin UI, on the other hand, is not affected by what you do here. That webpack build is separate.
:::

### Overriding other extensions

Why do the extensions have names? First, this way you can know the purpose of the extension at a glance. Second, this permits another module to override a previous extension by using the same name. In such a case, the last configured module wins.

Imagine your project contains a module you cannot modify which extends webpack in a way that doesn't work for your needs. You can override it in your own module by adding an extension with the same name.

Example:

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
  {
    modules: {
      // ...
      'test-1': {},
      'test-2': {}
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    app.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    webpack: {
      extensions: {
        addAlias: {
          resolve: {
            alias: {
              Special: path.join(process.cwd(), 'lib/original/')
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/test-1/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    webpack: {
      extensions: {
        addAlias: {
          resolve: {
            alias: {
              Special: path.join(process.cwd(), 'lib/different/')
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/test-2/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

Because the two extensions have the same name (`addAlias`) and the `test-2` module is configured last, import paths starting with `Special/` will point to `lib/different/` and not to `lib/original/`.

By contrast, if you use different extension names, two separate modules can contribute their own aliases. This works because they are automatically merged together with the main webpack configuration using [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge).

### Passing extensions options from any module

Webpack extensions can also be functions that take an `options` parameter.
From any module, you can declare an `extensionOptions` property in your webpack object. 
For each webpack extension found in the project, it will look for all `extensionOptions` of the same name and merge them in a single options object passed to the extension itself.

Example:

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    webpack: {
      extensions: {
        // Extension can be a function and return the final config
        addAlias (options) {
          return {
            stats: options.stats,
            resolve: {
              alias: options.alias || {}
            }
          }
        }
      },
      extensionOptions: {
        // Options can be a function to merge and return new options
        addAlias (options) {
          return {
            alias: {
              Special: path.join(process.cwd(), 'lib/different/'),
              ...options.alias || {}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/test-1/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    webpack: {
      extensionOptions: {
        addAlias (options) {
          return {
            alias: {
              ...options.alias || {},
              New: path.join(process.cwd(), 'lib/new/'),
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/test-2/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    webpack: {
      extensionOptions: {
        // It also can be a simple object if nothing has to be merged
        // We take care of merging first level properties
        addAlias: {
          stats: 'normal'
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/test-3/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

Following this example, the options object passed to the `addAlias` extension will look like this:
```javascript
{
  alias: {
    Special: path.join(process.cwd(), 'lib/different/'),
    New: path.join(process.cwd(), 'lib/new/')
  },
  stats: 'normal'
}
```

This way you'll be able to contribute to any webpack extension from any module in a flexible way.

## Extra bundles

If you have large amounts of frontend JavaScript that are specific to just one page or widget, you can generate "extra bundles" to be loaded only when those pages or widgets are present. For example, a widget that doesn't appear on most pages might require a large and complicated [player function](custom-widgets.md#client-side-javascript-for-widgets) with many imports of its own.

You can also configure the `@apostrophecms/asset` module to regroup JavaScript supplied in npm modules to better reflect how often the code is utilized within the project. 

::: warning
While extra bundles are a great feature, when used incorrectly they make sites slower, not faster.

Always ask yourself this question: **will a typical site visitor eventually load this code?** If so, you should **leave it in the main bundle** (import it from `ui/src/index.js`). This way the frequently needed code is always loaded up front and reused by every page without an extra request to the server.

Extra bundles should **only be used if the user probably won't need them on most visits.**
:::

### Extra bundles for widgets

We can contribute code to a new, named bundle by adding a `bundles` sub-section to `webpack` in any module. In this case we'll look at a module that implements a widget type called `test`:

<AposCodeBlock>

```javascript
  module.exports = {
    extend: '@apostrophecms/widget-type',
    webpack: {
      bundles: {
        'test': {}
      }
    }
  };
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/test-widget/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

Because we did this in a module that extends `@apostrophecms/widget-type`, Apostrophe  loads the bundle automatically on all pages that contain this particular widget.

### Where do I put my frontend code for the bundle?

Just like the main bundle, code for extra bundles lives in the `ui/src` subdirectory of your module. However rather than placing it in `ui/src/index.js` you will place it in `ui/src/bundlename.js`, where `bundlename` matches the name of your bundle. In the example above, it would be `ui/src/test.js`. That file might look like:

<AposCodeBlock>

```javascript
import { bigThing } from 'big-package';

export default () => {
  apos.util.widgetPlayers.test = {
    selector: '[data-test]',
    player: function (el) {
      // ... use bigThing here
    }
  };
};
```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/test-widget/ui/src/test.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

For completeness, we can also deliver stylesheets specific to this bundle in a `ui/src/test.scss` file. However it is usually more efficient to combine all styles in the main bundle.

::: info
Just like `ui/src/index.js`, `ui/src/test.js` must export a function. The exported functions are called in the order the modules that contribute to that bundle are configured in the project.
:::

### Extra bundles for page types

Let's say we have another bundle, `about-page`, and we want to load an extra bundle just on that particular page type. We can do it like this:

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      extend: '@apostrophecms/page-type',
      webpack: {
        bundles: {
          'about': {}
        }
      }
    }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/about-page/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

Since we named the bundle `about`, we should place our frontend code in the `ui/src/about.js` file of the `about-page` module.

### Extra bundles for piece page types

Now let's say we have a piece page type, `product-page`. this module extends `@apostrophecms/piece-page-type`, which has separate `index` and `show` templates (see [piece pages](piece-pages.md)). In this case, we want the `product` bundle to be loaded on the `index` pages but not on the `show` pages for individual pieces.

We can accomplish that with the `templates` sub-property:

<AposCodeBlock>

  ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      extend: '@apostrophecms/piece-page-type',
      webpack: {
        bundles: {
          'product': {
            templates: [ 'index' ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ```
  <template v-slot:caption>
    modules/product-page/index.js
  </template>
</AposCodeBlock>

Configuring `templates` is not mandatory. If we don't add the `templates` property, the bundle will be loaded on both `index` and `show` pages, which is often useful.

### Bundles can receive contributions from many modules

Note that since bundles have their own names, **any module can contribute to any bundle.** This includes support for multiple contributions to the same bundle from unrelated modules, and from "base class" modules like `@apostrophecms/piece-type`. This is deliberate because it helps us create a small number of bundles for more efficient page loading. Functionality that is usually found on the same page should be part of the same bundle.

### Shared dependencies

If a custom bundle imports packages that are also imported by the "main" bundle (the one created by `ui/src/index.js` files), those packages are only loaded once but are available to both bundles. This saves time loading the page. Dependencies that are imported by two separate *extra** bundles might be included twice, which should not impact functionality but can add to page load time.

### Deployment

Apostrophe will take care of deploying the output files of custom bundles alongside those generated by the main bundle. Apostrophe will also generate the needed `script` and `link` tags automatically.

### Rebundling resources

In some cases, an npm package will provide front-end code that is bundled in a way that doesn't reflect the needs of the project. In these cases, the bundle configuration set by each module can be overridden through the `rebundleModules` option of the `@apostrophecms/asset` module.

This option takes an object with module names, optionally combined with a `:` and a bundle name, as properties and new bundle names as values.

<AposCodeBlock>

``` js
module.exports = {
  options: {
    rebundleModules: {
      // Everything from the fancy-form module should go in the regular "main" bundle
      'fancy-form': 'main',
      // Everything from the basic-product module should go in the "secondary" bundle
      'basic-product': 'secondary',
      // Code originally designated as part of the `form` bundle from 
      // the @dcad/form module should be retargeted to the"secondary" bundle
      // but only that code, leave ui/src/index.js in the main bundle
      '@dcad/form:form': 'secondary'
    }
  }
};
```

<template v-slot:caption>
modules/@apostrophecms/asset/index.js
</template>
</AposCodeBlock>

If the module name is given, without specifying a bundle name, all of the JavaScript assets from the `module/ui/src` folder will be added to the newly specified bundle. If a bundle name is provided by appending it to the module name with a `:`, then only the assets of that bundle will be rebundled. Other assets in the same module's `ui/src` folder will behave according to the module's original bundle configuration, if any, or be left in the main bundle.

To avoid ambiguity, when using `rebundleModules` to move assets provided as part of the project-level configuration of an apostrophe module originally loaded from npm, such as code found in `modules/@apostrophecms/home-page/ui/src/index.js`, use the module name `@apostrophecms/my-home-page`. Without the `my-` prefix the code from the original npm module would be moved.

::: info
Sending all of the module assets to one bundle and then designating an entry point in that same folder to go to a different bundle is considered invalid. Instead, each individual entry point should be rebundled to achieve this goal.
:::

## The Webpack cache

Apostrophe uses webpack's built-in support for caching of modules in the filesystem. In normal use you should never have to worry about this, you simply benefit from a speed improvement. However, in certain scenarios you may wish to configure the location of the cache or clear it.

### Clearing the Webpack cache

In cases such as a change to your webpack configuration that Apostrophe cannot automatically detect and therefore fails to cause a desired change in the compiled output, you may need to clear the webpack cache. You can do that with this command line task:

```bash
node app @apostrophecms/asset:clear-cache
```

This task will be used rarely, as most changes to the webpack configuration are automatically detected. You will never need it if all you are doing is updating your frontend code.

### Configuring the location of the Webpack cache

By default, the cache is written to `data/temp`, relative to the project root. This works well in development and can work well in production as well, as long as `data` is a persistent folder.

In development, this usually doesn't require any change. However some attention must be paid to get the same performance improvement on later deployments that one receives in a development environment.

If the `data` folder is ephemeral (if it is erased with each new deployment), the speed improvement of caching is lost. If containers are being used, one solution to this is to make `data` a persistent volume via Docker. However if another location is desired, the `APOS_ASSET_CACHE` environment variable can be set to control this.

::: info
If the cache folder is not a persistent volume, nothing bad will happen. The asset build task will still succeed. Later deployments just won't be faster than the first one.
